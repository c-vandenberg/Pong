# Pong
This project recreates the classic game Pong by emulating the graphics, keyboard input, math, audio and physics of the original game. Project currently allows two players to play against each other. Player 1 moves paddles up and down using 'w' and 's' respectively, and player 2 using 'up' and 'down'. 

The two player project is finished, however an AI with varying difficulty is currently being implemented. Player will be able to choose a single or two player mode and a difficulty for the AI when in single player.
