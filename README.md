# Pong
This project recreates the classic game Pong by emulating the graphics, keyboard input, math, audio and physics of the original game. Project currently allows two players to play against each other, however an AI is currently being implemented for single player usage. Player 1 moves paddles up and down using 'w' and 's' respectively, and player 2 using 'up' and 'down'. 

Project is currently in progress, however the most recent update has added collision detection so there is enought functionality to play. Features to be implemented are a scoring system, the ball resetting after a player scores, and the audio. LÃ–VE or an equivalent engine is required to play.
