# Pong
This project recreates the classic game Pong by emulating the graphics, keyboard input, math, audio and physics of the original game. Project currently allows two players to play against each other. Player 1 moves paddles up and down using 'w' and 's' respectively, and player 2 using 'up' and 'down'. 

Currently the player can choose one of two game modes; Player vs Player and Player vs Computer. An easy and impossibe AI difficulty have been made, and once a medium and hard difficulty have been implemented all 4 will be added.
